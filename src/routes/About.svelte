    <br><br>
    From a young age, I've harbored a strong interest in the world of computers. My passion for technology has been evident since childhood, and I've found immense joy in exploring and understanding various programming concepts.
    <br><br>
    <span class="pengenalan">My journey began with my first encounter with Python programming language, which sparked my curiosity and eventually led me to explore other languages such as <b> JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Php, React Native, Flutter </b> and more. Each language has broadened my understanding of software development and fueled my passion for creating innovative solutions.</span>
    <br><br>
    Over time, my interest has grown, and I've developed a love for coding as a means to explore my creativity and tackle new challenges. One aspect that particularly intrigues me is the use of the Linux operating system.
    <br><br>
    I've discovered remarkable practicality and flexibility in using Linux, and it has become an integral part of my development journey. With Linux, I feel empowered with greater control over my development environment, allowing me to delve deeper into areas such as automation, customization, and a deeper understanding of systems.
    <br><br>
    My affinity for Linux  isn't just about using an alternative operating system; it's also a part of my identity as someone who enjoys exploration, problem-solving, and continual learning in the realm of technology.
